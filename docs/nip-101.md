======
`draft` `optional` `author:abhay-raizada` `author:rramaa` 

## Scope


- Create a Form Template (Optional Kind 0 that says, "This is a nostr form")
    - Define kind for form template
    - SchemaLink & Formstr Schema
    - Private/Public Forms
    - Sharing
- View Template
    - Decrypt form template for private forms
- Send Form Responses
    - Define kind for form responses
    - Encryption  Standard (nip44?)
    - Response Schema
- View Responses
    - Decryption of responses
## Form Template
Each form is a new nostr identity (npub), and the corresponding form template is stored
in a parameterized replaceable event of `kind: 30168`

### Form Metatadata

### Private Forms

the form template could be either in plain-text or encrypted using a symmetric encryption key, with encryption standard as part of the metadata, and the key maybe shared through different channels or be a part of 
the form url. 

## Sharing

- Links to be created with either the form pubkey along with an optional key for private forms, or an `nprofile` with encoded relays and an optional key, for relay-encoded forms.


## View Template

Public Forms can be viewable as is, private forms would need to be decrypted using the symmetric key.

## Send Responses

Responses are to be encrypted via the encryption standard under nip-44(check for signer support?) and sent as a `kind: 30169` event

## Response Schema

## View Responses

responses to be viewed after decryption using the
